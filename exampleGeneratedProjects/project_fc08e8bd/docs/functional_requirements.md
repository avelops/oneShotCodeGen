   - Users can search for tasks by title or keywords in the description.

2. **User Roles and Permissions:**

     - Permissions:
       - Full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) access to their own tasks.

3. **Data Entities and Relationships:**
   - **Task:**
     - Attributes: Title, Description, Due Date, Priority Level, Status, Category/Tag, Creation Timestamp, Last Updated Timestamp.
   - **Category/Tag:**
     - Attributes: Name.
     - Relationship: A task can belong to one or more categories/tags.

     - Displays a list of tasks.
     - Includes sorting and filtering options.
     - Search bar at the top to find tasks.
     - Button to add a new task.
   - **Task Creation/Editing Screen:**
     - Form with input fields to add or edit task attributes (title, description, due date, priority, status, category).
     - Save and cancel buttons.

     - Tasks > Add Task.
     - Categories/Tags > Add/Edit/Delete Categories.

4. **Design Preferences:**
   - Clean and minimalistic design.
   - Use of a neutral color palette with accent colors for priority levels (e.g., red for high priority, yellow for medium, green for low).
   - Task statuses visually distinguished (e.g., color-coded labels or badges).

5. **Usability and Accessibility Considerations:**
   - Simple, intuitive navigation.
   - Mobile-friendly responsive design.
   - Ensure compatibility with screen readers for visually impaired users.
   - Include keyboard shortcuts for power users (e.g., "N" for new task, "E" for edit).

### **User Flows**

1. **Creating a Task:**
   1. User navigates to the Home Screen.
   2. User clicks the "Add Task" button.
   3. System opens the Task Creation Screen with a form.
   4. User fills in task details and clicks "Save."
   5. System saves the task and redirects back to the Home Screen with the new task listed.

2. **Editing a Task:**
   1. User selects a task from the list on the Home Screen.
   2. System opens the Task Details Screen.
   3. User clicks the "Edit" button.
   4. System opens the Task Editing Screen with pre-filled details.
   5. User modifies the details and clicks "Save."
   6. System updates the task and redirects back to the Home Screen.

3. **Deleting a Task:**
   1. User selects a task from the list on the Home Screen.
   2. System opens the Task Details Screen.
   3. User clicks the "Delete" button.
   4. System prompts a confirmation dialog.
   5. User confirms the action, and the system deletes the task.

4. **Filtering Tasks:**
   1. User selects a filter or sorting option from the dropdown on the Home Screen.
   2. System updates the task list view based on the selected filter/sort criteria.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Performance:**
   - The app should load the task list within 2 seconds for up to 100 tasks.
   - Support for up to 1,000 tasks without significant performance degradation.

2. **Security:**
   - Basic authentication with a single user (e.g., email and password or app-generated token).
   - Security is minimal and not a priority for this version.

3. **Scalability:**
   - The app should be designed to allow future enhancements, such as multi-user support or integration with external APIs (e.g., Google Calendar).

4. **Reliability:**
   - The app should handle basic error cases, such as invalid input or failed task creation (e.g., due to an empty title).

5. **Compliance and Regulatory Considerations:**
   - No specific compliance requirements for this version.

6. **User Types and Roles:**
   - Single user type for this version: Individual user managing personal tasks.

---

### **Constraints and Assumptions**

1. **Technological Constraints:**
   - The application is an internal tool, so it does not require a highly secure authentication mechanism.
   - Keep the authentication flow simple (e.g., hardcoded credentials or basic email/password login).

2. **Technological Preferences:**
   - Use a modern web framework for the front end (e.g., React, Vue.js).
   - Use a lightweight backend framework (e.g., Node.js with Express, or Flask).
   - Store data locally for simplicity (e.g., SQLite, or browser localStorage).

3. **Assumptions:**
   - The user is the only individual using the app, so multi-user functionality is not required.
   - The app will not integrate with third-party services in the initial version.
   - Minimal branding or customization is required for this version.

This document captures the key requirements for building a simple, functional todo application. Future iterations can expand on these features based on additional user needs.
